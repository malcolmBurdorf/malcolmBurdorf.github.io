      <description>Hello. This is my first post. I would like to provide some information on how I created this website with Hugo and deployed it with Github Pages. Hopefully, this will be helpful for people like me, or my future self, since I just went through the process. This will be specifically for Windows, since that is the OS that I used.
Firstly, this will basically be a summary of both the Hugo Quick Start page and The Simple Engineer&amp;rsquo;s video, so please look at those, if you would like more information.</description>
